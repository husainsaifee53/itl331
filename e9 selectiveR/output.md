// # **Selective Repeat Protocol**



// ### AIM:

// Implementation of Medium Access Control protocols - Selective Repeat



// ### ALGORITHM:

// #### SERVER:

// 1. Start.
// 2. Establish connection (recommended UDP).
// 3. Accept the window size from the client (should be â‰¤ 40).
// 4. Accept the packets from the network layer.
// 5. Calculate the total frames/windows required.
// 6. Send the details to the client (total packets, total frames).
// 7. Initialize the transmit buffer.
// 8. Build the frame/window depending on the window size.
// 9. Transmit the frame.
// 10. Wait for the acknowledgement frame.
// 11. Check for the acknowledgement of each packet and retransmit packets for which negative acknowledgement is received. Otherwise, continue as usual.
// 12. Increment the frame count and repeat steps 7 to 12 until all packets are transmitted.
// 13. Close the connection.
// 14. Stop.

// #### CLIENT:

// 1. Start.
// 2. Establish a connection (recommended UDP).
// 3. Send the window size on server request.
// 4. Accept the details from the server (total packets, total frames).
// 5. Initialize the receive buffer with the expected packets.
// 6. Accept the frame/window from the server.
// 7. Check validity of the packets and construct the acknowledgement frame depending on validity (acknowledgements accepted from user).
// 8. Depending on the acknowledgement frame, readjust the process.
// 9. Increment the frame count and repeat steps 5 to 9 until all packets are received.
